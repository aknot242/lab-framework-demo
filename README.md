# Lab Framework Demo
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) demo using [Tailwinds CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), and [Next-MDX-Remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote) to provide interactive lab guides to students.

## Getting Started

First, install the node packages:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the lab markdown page by modifying `app/lab/lab.mdx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
